                <img src ="images/silphium.jpg" alt="Image 1" data-info="Silphium, a plant native to North Africa, was highly prized in the ancient world, particularly for its medicinal properties. Its most notable use, however, was as a contraceptive. In the 1st century AD, it was considered a valuable commodity, often used by women to regulate their fertility.
        
                While the exact mechanism by which silphium acted as a contraceptive is unknown, it is believed to have had hormonal properties that interfered with ovulation or implantation. This made it a popular choice for women who wished to avoid pregnancy without resorting to other, less reliable methods.
                
                Unfortunately, due to overharvesting and habitat destruction, silphium is now extinct. Its disappearance has left a void in the history of contraception and has sparked interest in researching potential modern alternatives.

It is the only member of the genus Nesiota. It was endemic to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. Despite its name, it is unrelated to the true olive (Olea europaea), but is instead a member of the family Rhamnaceae, the family which contains buckthorns and jujube. The last remaining tree in the wild died in 1994, and the last remaining individual in cultivation died in December 2003, despite conservation efforts. It is thus a prime example of recent plant extinction. The Saint Helena olive belongs to the tribe Phyliceae, which are mostly endemic to Southern Africa."  data-image="images/saint helena.jpg">

The name Glossopteris refers only to leaves, within the framework of form genera used in paleobotany (for likely reproductive organs, see Glossopteridaceae).

            Species of Glossopteris were the dominant trees of the middle to high-latitude lowland vegetation across the supercontinent Gondwana during the Permian Period. Glossopteris fossils were critical in recognizing former connections between the various fragments of Gondwana: South America, Africa, India, Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica." data-image="images/glossopteris.jpg">
            <img src ="images/Lepidodendron.png" alt="Image 1" data-info="Lepidodendron is an extinct genus of primitive lycopodian vascular plants belonging the order Lepidodendrales. It is well preserved and common in the fossil record. Like other Lepidodendrales, species of Lepidodendron grew as large-tree-like plants in wetland coal forest environments. They sometimes reached heights of 50 metres (160 feet),[1] and the trunks were often over 1 m (3 ft 3 in) in diameter. They are often known as scale trees, due to their bark having been covered in diamond shaped leaf-bases, from which leaves grew during earlier stages of growth. However, they are correctly defined as arborescent lycophytes. They thrived during the Carboniferous Period (358.9 to 298.9 million years ago), and persisted until the end of the Permian around 252 million years ago. Sometimes erroneously called giant club mosses, the genus was actually more closely related to modern quillworts than to modern club mosses. In the form classification system used in paleobotany, Lepidodendron is both used for the whole plant as well as specifically the stems and leaves." data-image="images/Lepidodendron.png">

            <img src ="images/Archaeopteris_hibernica.JPG" alt="Image 1" data-info="Archaeopteris is an extinct genus of progymnosperm tree with fern-like leaves. A useful index fossil, this tree is found in strata dating from the Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous (383 to 323 million years ago), the oldest fossils being 385 million years old,[1] and had global distribution.

            Until the 2007 discovery of Wattieza, many scientists considered Archaeopteris to be the earliest known tree. Bearing buds, reinforced branch joints, and branched trunks similar to today's woody plants, it is more reminiscent of modern seed-bearing trees than other spore-bearing taxa. It combines characteristics of woody trees and herbaceous ferns, and belongs to the progymnosperms, a group of extinct plants more closely related to seed plants than to ferns, but unlike seed plants, reproducing using spores like ferns."  data-image="images/Archaeopteris_hibernica.jpg">

            <img src ="images/Lepidopteris.jpg" alt="Image 1" data-info="Pteridospermatophyta, also called pteridosperms or seed ferns are a polyphyletic[1] grouping of extinct seed-producing plants. The earliest fossil evidence for plants of this type are the lyginopterids of late Devonian age.[2] They flourished particularly during the Carboniferous and Permian periods. Pteridosperms declined during the Mesozoic Era and had mostly disappeared by the end of the Cretaceous Period, though Komlopteris seem to have survived into Eocene times, based on fossil finds in Tasmania.[3]

            With regard to the enduring utility of this division, many palaeobotanists still use the pteridosperm grouping in an informal sense to refer to the seed plants that are not angiosperms, coniferoids (conifers or cordaites), ginkgophytes or cycadophytes (cycads or bennettites). This is particularly useful for extinct seed plant groups whose systematic relationships remain speculative, as they can be classified as pteridosperms with no valid implications being made as to their systematic affinities. Also, from a purely curatorial perspective the term pteridosperms is a useful shorthand for describing the fern-like fronds that were probably produced by seed plants, which are commonly found in many Palaeozoic and Mesozoic fossil floras." data-image="images/Lepidopteris.jpg">
            <img src ="images/Cooksonia.png" alt="Image 1" data-info="Cooksonia is an extinct group of primitive land plants, treated as a genus, although probably not monophyletic. The earliest Cooksonia date from the middle of the Silurian (the Wenlock epoch);[1] the group continued to be an important component of the flora until the end of the Early Devonian, a total time span of 433 to 393 million years ago. While Cooksonia fossils are distributed globally, most type specimens come from Britain, where they were first discovered in 1937.[4] Cooksonia includes the oldest known plant to have a stem with vascular tissue and is thus a transitional form between the primitive non-vascular bryophytes and the vascular plants."  data-image="images/Cooksonia.png">
